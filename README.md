# Study of Stanford Open Data Project Traffic Stops in Hartford, CT
I have three ways through which I have studied the dataset, which include building a table that shows the arrest rate for different genders and races, a graph that depicts the number of stops made per each minute of the day, and a map that shows the locations of arrests made in Hartford depending on the gender of the individual arrested. 
The Rmd file includes my code and comments used to plot these graphs and the html output shows the plots. 
I have downloaded the data from the Stanford Open Data Project https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/
